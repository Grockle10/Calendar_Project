I was able to extract some files from the hardrive of my broken laptop, 
and pulled out the code for the calendar I coded but was not able to use 
in the website, code should be slightly commented as it was not the last 
versions of the file, but I hope you can still mark it despite not being 
submitted on time as I did not pull the hardrive till today.7
